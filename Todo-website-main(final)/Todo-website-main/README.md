# Todo-website
+ Added to Chu's To-Do to add a functioning image selector, although I ran into problems which disallowed me to allow the user to upload their own files. To do so, you need to have a server/database and use a coding-language that isn't in our curriculum. I do apologize!

+ Finalized Calendar page. Fully dynamic dates, along with the days of the month changing dynamically as well. I also included the weather API.
